Fisdap narrative formatter.
This is a program made using auto hot key to make writing patient care reports [PCR] narratives easier. You write the corresponding information on the text boxes and then it generates a narrative of the "SOAP" structure that can then be pasted into the narrative section of Fisdap. It makes adding finding and vitals easier to the pcr.
